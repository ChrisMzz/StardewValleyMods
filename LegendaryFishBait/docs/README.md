# Legendary Fish Bait

You've maybe tried to put a Legendary Fish in a bait maker, only to notice it gives you some bait for that fish. With this mod you can actually use this bait!

This was already possible with previous mods, which could allow for unlimited Legendary Fish, but LegendaryFishBait tries to provide a more balanced experience by only allowing the fish to spawn if you're using the bait specific to them. Bait makers are accessible from level 6 (with one being offered as a Community Center reward).

In case you've already used all the bait, or used/lost a Legendary Fish, you can always buy the bait at Willy's shop, but to balance this, the bait will only be available once you've caught the fish and reached level 10 Fishing.


**This is currently a beta version of the mod, I've found some bugs with it altering spawn tables whenever it's used with mods that add fish to the game such as Stardew Valley Expanded.** Please report any bugs you find so I can test and fix them!

Wishing you a pleasant experience with this mod!
